\usage{
preprocess_data(
  data,
  remove_na = TRUE,
  normalize = TRUE,
  labels = c("CON", "Treatment")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the raw dataset. It must include a column named `class` which represents the target variable.}

\item{remove_na}{Logical, indicating whether to remove rows with missing values in the `class` column. **Note:** This parameter is currently not utilized in the function logic; rows with `NA` in `class` are always removed.}

\item{normalize}{Logical, indicating whether to normalize numeric feature columns by dividing by their maximum value (scaling to [0, 1]). Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{labels}{A character vector specifying the factor levels for the `class` column, defining the order of groups (e.g., control group first). Default is `c("CON", "Treatment")`.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{X} - A numeric matrix representing the processed feature variables (all columns except `class`).
  \item \code{y} - A factor vector derived from the `class` column, with levels set according to the `labels` parameter.
}
}
\description{
This function performs data cleaning and preprocessing on a dataset intended for machine learning tasks. It handles missing values, optional normalization of numeric features, and separates the data into feature matrix and label vector.
}
\details{
The preprocessing steps are executed as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item **Data Cleaning:** Rows with missing values (`NA`) in the `class` column are removed.
  \item **Column Name Cleaning:** Leading and trailing whitespace from all column names are trimmed.
  \item **Missing Value Imputation:** For each numeric feature column (all columns except `class`), missing values (`NA`) are replaced with half the mean of the non-missing values in that column.
  \item **Normalization:** If `normalize = TRUE`, each numeric feature column is divided by its maximum value to scale the data between 0 and 1.
  \item **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into a numeric matrix `X` (features) and a factor vector `y` (labels).
}
Non-numeric columns other than `class` may cause errors during conversion to matrix and are not explicitly handled in the current function.

# Create a sample dataset

                          normalize = TRUE,
                          labels = c("CON", "Treatment"))
