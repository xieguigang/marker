\title{Predict using a pre-trained ensemble model}
\usage{
predict_with_saved_model(new_data, model_dir = "saved_models")
}
\arguments{
\item{new_data}{A data.frame or matrix containing the new data to make predictions on.
It should contain all the features used during model training.}

\item{model_dir}{Character string specifying the directory path where the ensemble model
components and metadata are stored. Default is "saved_models".}
}
\value{
A data.frame with row names corresponding to `new_data` and three columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{xgb}: Prediction probabilities from the XGBoost model
    \item \code{lr}: Prediction probabilities from the Logistic Regression model  
    \item \code{rf}: Prediction probabilities from the Random Forest model
  }
  All predictions are returned as probabilities (numeric values between 0 and 1).
}
\description{
This function loads a saved ensemble model (comprising XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models)
and generates predictions on new data. The ensemble model must have been previously saved using
`save_ensemble_models()` or a compatible function.
}
\note{
Important considerations for use:
\itemize{
  \item The function assumes the ensemble model was saved using `save_ensemble_models()` 
        or a compatible method that includes metadata about features used during training.
  \item The new data must contain at least all the features that were used in model training.
  \item Feature names and data types in `new_data` should match those used during training.
  \item This function is designed for classification tasks and returns probability scores.
