\title{Load required packages for analysis}
\usage{
.requires()
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It is called for its side effects, which are
attaching the specified packages to the search path and configuring `showtext`[1](@ref).
}
\description{
This function loads a comprehensive set of R packages commonly used for data analysis,
machine learning, visualization, and handling specific issues like Chinese character
display in graphics. It is intended to be executed at the beginning of an analysis
script to ensure all necessary dependencies are available.
}
\details{
The function loads packages from several key categories:
\itemize{
  \item **Machine Learning**: `glmnet`, `randomForest`, `e1071`, `caret`, `xgboost`, `SHAPforxgboost`
  \item **Data Visualization**: `ggplot2`, `pheatmap`, `ggcorrplot`, `ggthemes`, `showtext`
  \item **Data Manipulation**: `dplyr`, `tidyverse`
  \item **Model Evaluation & Analysis**: `pROC`, `rmda`
  \item **Excel File Handling**: `xlsx`, `openxlsx`
}
Additionally, it enables `showtext` automatic rendering to address Chinese character
display issues in PDF graphics[4](@ref).
}
\section{Side effects}{

\itemize{
  \item Attaches multiple packages to the R session using `library()`.
  \item Enables `showtext_auto()` to automatically handle text rendering, which is
  particularly useful for displaying Chinese characters in graphics[4](@ref).
}
}

\section{Warning}{

\itemize{
  \item The function uses `library()` to attach packages, which will mask functions
  if multiple packages contain functions with the same name. It does not check if
  packages are already installed or loaded[3](@ref).
  \item The package `randomForest` is loaded twice in the code; you may consider
  removing the duplicate call for efficiency.
  \item Ensure that all packages listed are installed in your R environment before
  calling this function, as missing packages will cause errors[3](@ref).
