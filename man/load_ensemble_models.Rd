\title{Load ensemble models from a specified directory}
\usage{
load_ensemble_models(model_dir = "saved_models")
}
\arguments{
\item{model_dir}{A character string specifying the path to the directory containing the saved model files.
Default is "saved_models". The function will check this directory for the following files:
\itemize{
  \item "logistic_model.rds" for the logistic regression model
  \item "xgb_model.model" for the XGBoost model
  \item "xgb_features.json" for the XGBoost feature names
  \item "rf_model.rds" for the random forest model
  \item "model_metadata.rds" for general model metadata
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the loaded models and associated data. The list structure may include:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{nomogram} - Logistic regression model (if "logistic_model.rds" exists)
    \item \code{xgb} - XGBoost model object (if "xgb_model.model" exists)
    \item \code{xgb_features} - Character vector of feature names used by the XGBoost model (if "xgb_features.json" exists)
    \item \code{rf} - Random forest model (if "rf_model.rds" exists)
    \item \code{metadata} - Additional model metadata (if "model_metadata.rds" exists)
  }
  If a particular model file does not exist, the corresponding list element will be omitted.
}
\description{
This function loads pre-saved ensemble machine learning models and their associated metadata from a local directory.
It supports loading multiple model types including logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest models,
checking for the existence of each model file before attempting to load them.

# Load models from the default directory "saved_models"
ensemble_models <- load_ensemble_models()

# Load models from a custom directory path
ensemble_models <- load_ensemble_models(model_dir = "my_model_directory")

# Access individual models
logistic_model <- ensemble_models$nomogram
