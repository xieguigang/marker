\usage{
marker(
  file_path,
  class,
  sel_features = NULL,
  training_size = 0.7,
  top_features = 6,
  save_dir = "./"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character string specifying the path to the input data file.
The file should contain both features and class labels.}

\item{class}{Vector specifying the class labels to be included in the analysis.
Only samples with these class labels will be used.}

\item{sel_features}{Optional character vector of pre-selected features.
If provided (default is NULL), the function skips automated feature
selection and uses these features directly.}

\item{training_size}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
of data to be used for training. Default is 0.7 (70% training, 30% testing).}

\item{top_features}{Integer specifying the number of top features to select
when \code{sel_features} is NULL. Default is 6.}

\item{save_dir}{Character string specifying the directory path for saving
results. Default is current directory ("./").}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function primarily generates
   visualization outputs and prints diagnostic information to the console.
   Key side effects include:
   \itemize{
     \item Feature selection results when \code{sel_features} is NULL
     \item Model ensemble performance metrics
     \item Visualization plots in the specified directory
   }
}
\description{
This function performs comprehensive marker identification and validation
through a multi-step process including data loading, feature selection,
model ensemble and result visualization. It integrates LASSO, Random Forest
and SVM-RFE algorithms for robust feature selection.
}
\details{
The function executes the following pipeline:
\enumerate{
  \item Data loading and preprocessing using \code{preprocess_data()}
  \item Feature selection (if \code{sel_features} not provided) using three
        methods: LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE
  \item Data splitting into training and testing sets
  \item Model ensemble training on selected features
  \item Result visualization and performance assessment
}

When \code{sel_features} is NULL, the feature selection process combines
results from multiple algorithms and selects the most frequently identified
features based on \code{top_features} parameter.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage with automated feature selection
marker("data.csv", class = c("A", "B"), top_features = 10)

# Using pre-selected features
marker("data.csv", class = "A", sel_features = c("gene1", "gene2"))

# Custom training size and save directory
marker("data.csv", class = c("A", "B"),
       training_size = 0.8, save_dir = "./results/")
}
