\usage{
marker(
  file_path,
  class,
  sel_features = NULL,
  training_size = 0.7,
  top_features = 6,
  save_dir = "./"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character string specifying the path to the input data file. The file should contain both features and class labels and be readable into a data frame.}

\item{class}{Vector specifying the class labels to be included in the analysis. Only samples with these class labels will be used.}

\item{sel_features}{Optional character vector of pre-selected features. If provided (default is NULL), the function skips automated feature selection and uses these features directly.}

\item{training_size}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion of data to be used for training. Default is 0.7 (70% training, 30% testing).}

\item{top_features}{Integer specifying the number of top features to select when \code{sel_features} is NULL. Default is 6.}

\item{save_dir}{Character string specifying the directory path for saving results. Default is current directory ("./"). The function will create subdirectories (e.g., "linears", "machine_learning", "data") under this path if they do not exist.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function primarily generates side effects including:
\itemize{
  \item Feature selection results (when \code{sel_features} is NULL) saved as "feature_selection.json"
  \item Model ensemble performance metrics and plots in the "machine_learning" subdirectory
  \item PCA plot, linear analysis results, and statistical data in respective subdirectories
  \item Training and testing datasets saved in the "data" subdirectory
}
}
\description{
This function performs comprehensive marker identification and validation through a multi-step process including data loading, feature selection, model ensemble, and result visualization. It integrates LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE algorithms for robust feature selection.
}
\details{
The function executes the following pipeline:
\enumerate{
  \item Data loading and preprocessing using \code{preprocess_data()}
  \item Initial visualization and statistical analysis (PCA, linear models, descriptive statistics)
  \item Feature selection (if \code{sel_features} not provided) using three methods: LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE
  \item Data splitting into training and testing sets using \code{createDataPartition}
  \item Model ensemble training on selected features using \code{ensemble_model}
  \item Result visualization and performance assessment using \code{visualize_results}
}

When \code{sel_features} is NULL, the feature selection process combines results from multiple algorithms and selects the most frequently identified features based on the \code{top_features} parameter.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage with automated feature selection
marker("data.csv", class = c("A", "B"), top_features = 10)

# Using pre-selected features
marker("data.csv", class = "A", sel_features = c("gene1", "gene2"))

# Custom training size and save directory
marker("data.csv", class = c("A", "B"),
       training_size = 0.8, save_dir = "./results/")
}
