\usage{
perform_statistical_test(feature_vector, class_vector, CON, treatment)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_vector}{A numeric vector representing the feature values to be tested. Can contain binary (0/1) or continuous values.}

\item{class_vector}{A factor or character vector indicating the group membership (e.g., "Negative", "Positive") for each sample. Must be the same length as `feature_vector`.}

\item{CON}{A scalar value (typically 0, or a reference level in `class_vector`) denoting the control or reference group (e.g., negative class).}

\item{treatment}{A scalar value (typically 1, or a test level in `class_vector`) denoting the experimental or test group (e.g., positive class).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{method} - Character. Name of the statistical test performed ("Fisher exact test" for binary features, "Chi-squared" for continuous features).
  \item \code{statistic} - Numeric. The test statistic (Odds Ratio for Fisher's exact test, Chi-squared statistic for Chi-squared test).
  \item \code{pvalue} - Numeric. The p-value from the statistical test.
  \item \code{feature_type} - Character. Type of the input feature ("binary" or "continuous").
  \item **If the feature is binary**, the list additionally contains:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{negative_0} - Numeric. Count of reference group (class = `CON`) samples where the feature value is 0.
      \item \code{negative_1} - Numeric. Count of reference group samples where the feature value is 1.
      \item \code{positive_0} - Numeric. Count of test group (class = `treatment`) samples where the feature value is 0.
      \item \code{positive_1} - Numeric. Count of test group samples where the feature value is 1.
    }
  \item **If the feature is continuous**, the list additionally contains:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{negative_mean} - Numeric. Mean of the feature values in the reference group.
      \item \code{negative_sd} - Numeric. Standard deviation of the feature values in the reference group.
      \item \code{positive_mean} - Numeric. Mean of the feature values in the test group.
      \item \code{positive_sd} - Numeric. Standard deviation of the feature values in the test group.
    }
}
}
\description{
This function automatically determines the appropriate statistical test (Fisher's exact test for binary features, 
Chi-squared test for continuous features) to compare the distribution of a feature between two groups (e.g., negative vs. positive classes).

# Example 1: Binary feature test
feature_binary <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1)
class_labels <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1) # 0: Negative, 1: Positive
result_bin <- perform_statistical_test(feature_binary, class_labels, CON = 0, treatment = 1)
print(result_bin)

# Example 2: Continuous feature test
feature_cont <- rnorm(30, mean = 10, sd = 2)
class_labels_cont <- rep(c(0, 1), each = 15)
result_cont <- perform_statistical_test(feature_cont, class_labels_cont, CON = 0, treatment = 1)
print(result_cont)
