\title{SVM-RFE Feature Selection}
\usage{
run_svm_rfe(X, y, n_features = 5, metric = "Accuracy", kernel = "radial", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame where rows represent samples and columns represent
features/genes. This is the predictor variable matrix.}

\item{y}{A factor or numeric vector containing the outcome/target variable corresponding
to the samples in `X`.}

\item{n_features}{An integer specifying the maximum number of top features to select.
The function will evaluate feature subsets from 1 to `n_features`. Default is 5.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating the performance metric to use for evaluating
feature subsets. Common metrics include "Accuracy" for classification or "RMSE" for
regression. Default is "Accuracy".}

\item{kernel}{A character string specifying the SVM kernel type. Must be one of:
"radial" (default), "linear", "polynomial", or "sigmoid". Each kernel has different
characteristics for handling non-linear decision boundaries.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the SVM model, allowing customization of
parameters such as `cost`, `gamma`, `degree`, etc. These will override default
kernel parameters.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{features} - A character vector of the names of the selected features
      (if `X` has column names) or indices of the selected features.
    \item \code{model} - The final SVM model trained on the selected features.
    \item \code{error} - A vector of performance metric values (e.g., RMSE) from the
      resampling process for each feature subset size.

\description{
Performs feature selection using Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE).
This function implements a wrapper feature selection method that recursively removes the least
important features based on SVM weights, ultimately selecting the optimal feature subset.
}
\details{
This function utilizes the \code{caret} package's \code{rfe} function to implement
SVM-RFE. The algorithm works as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item Train an SVM model on all features and rank features by their importance
    (based on weight magnitude in linear SVM or variable importance for non-linear kernels).
  \item Remove the least important feature(s).
  \item Repeat the process recursively on the remaining feature set.
  \item Evaluate model performance at each step using cross-validation.
  \item Select the feature subset that yields optimal performance based on the specified metric.
}

The function includes predefined parameter templates for different SVM kernels and
uses 10-fold cross-validation by default for robust feature evaluation.

\donttest{
# Load required library
library(caret)

# Example with iris dataset (classification)
data(iris)
X <- iris[, 1:4]  # Feature matrix
y <- iris[, 5]    # Target variable

# Perform SVM-RFE feature selection with radial kernel
result <- run_svm_rfe(X, y, n_features = 3, kernel = "radial")

# Print selected features
print(result$features)

# Plot feature selection results (if available)
plot(result$model)
